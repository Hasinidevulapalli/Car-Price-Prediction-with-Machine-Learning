## 🔍 Steps Performed

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Loaded the car price dataset (CSV format) from a public source.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values, encoded categorical data (e.g., brand, fuel type), and scaled numerical features.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualized feature distributions and correlations using `seaborn` and `matplotlib`.
   - Identified key factors influencing car prices.

4. **Model Training**  
   - Applied regression algorithms such as:
     - Linear Regression  
     - Random Forest Regressor  
     - Decision Tree Regressor
   - Used train-test split to evaluate model performance.

5. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Evaluated models using metrics like R² Score, MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and RMSE.
