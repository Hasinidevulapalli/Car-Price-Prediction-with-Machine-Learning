# 🚗 Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the resale price of used cars using features such as present price, fuel type, kilometers driven, transmission type, and number of owners. The model is trained using Random Forest Regressor and includes proper data preprocessing, visualization, and evaluation.

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: `car data.csv`
- Rows: 301
- Key Features: Year, Present_Price, Driven_kms, Fuel_Type, Transmission, Owner

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 🔍 Workflow
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Feature Engineering (`Car_Age`)
3. Categorical Encoding (One-Hot Encoding)
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
5. Model Building using Random Forest Regressor
6. Evaluation using R² Score and Mean Squared Error
7. Feature Importance Analysis
8. Predicted vs Actual Plot

## 📈 Results
- Achieved high model accuracy
- Identified key factors impacting resale value (e.g., present price, fuel type)
